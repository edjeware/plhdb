Typing "make" in any directory gets help on the Makefile's targets.

mkdir /var/www/includes
cd /var/www/includes

wget https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/download/v4.8.1/adminer-4.8.1.php
# symlink to the name used by the index.php code
ln -s adminer-4.8.1.php adminer-current

Database Install
++++++++++++++++

sudo make cluster
# See the "examples" dir for PG config/tuning examples
sudo make backup_dir
# Do something to start the postgres cluster here.
sudo su postgres -c 'make roles'
make databases

# For each of the databases (plhdb, plhdb_test, plhdb_copy, plhdb_test
# plhdb_demo) do:
make PLHDB_DB=$dbname install

# Make a person administrative user with something like:
plhdb-user-add -a plhdb_admin person_admin \
               "Person's administrator account"
# The new administrative user can make managers
# (They should probably make themselves a manager account)
plhdb-user-add -a person_admin person plhdb_managers \
               "Person's regular (manager) account for research"
# The new administrative user can also make study users
plhdb-user-add -a person_admin person2 plhdb_users \
               "Person2's regular (read-only) account for research"
# A manager user must add rows to the PERMISSION table for each
# study user for each study to which the study user is to have
# search, insert, edit, or all access.  See: db/README


Upgrading Adminer
-----------------

# To upgrade adminer, get the latest version and update the
# /var/www/includes/adminer-current symlink.
# Then restart php fpm.  (Or use the big hammer and reboot.)
